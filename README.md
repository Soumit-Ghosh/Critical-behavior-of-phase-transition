# Critical-behavior-of-phase-transition
This project mainly focuses on the second-order Ferromagnetic to Paramagnetic (FM-PM)  phase transition and studies the critical exponent beta(Î²) behavior near the critical temperature and away from the critical temperature.

Methodology:
To study the power-law variation for critical exponent of second-order FM-PM phase transition, we use Python programming to calculate the slope at each point of the power-law plot near the critical temperature. We also plot the critical exponent plot.
